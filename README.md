## ‚òÅÔ∏è How to Deploy (Streamlit Community Cloud)

This application was made live on the web in minutes using **Streamlit Community Cloud**‚Äîthe recommended method for deploying Streamlit applications hosted on GitHub.

### 1. Requirements on GitHub

Ensure your GitHub repository contains these files at the root level, and that the large `.h5` model was pushed using **Git LFS**.

### 2. Deployment Steps

1.  Log in to the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) using your GitHub account.
2.  Click the **"New App"** button.
3.  Fill in the details:
    * **Repository:** Select your GitHub project repository.
    * **Branch:** Select the deployment branch (e.g., `main`).
    * **Main file path:** Ensure this is set to `app.py`.
4.  Click **"Deploy!"** Streamlit automatically clones the repo, installs packages from `requirements.txt`, handles the large LFS file, and launches the application.
